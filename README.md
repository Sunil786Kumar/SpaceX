I have used MVVM deisgn pattern where viewModel is initiated in each controller and all the logic stays in the viewModel and controller is updated with presenter/delegate.

Test cases should have written in the beginning, i was not sure how much time I could manage. I have added couple of test cases to demonstrate all the model data is testable.

I had included rxSwift pod but could not manage time to implement it. I wanted to do it at the last thing. I have used rxSwift in Ladbrokes couple of years ago. 

There is some redundant code, could be refactored.
